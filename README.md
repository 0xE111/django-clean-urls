# django-clean-urls
Package for creation hierarchical clean URLs in Django.

## Overview
Django by default forces developers to use *static* URLs - by the word "static" I mean both fixed URL depth and that each URL is constant except some small chunks that change (usually instance's `pk` and/or `slug`). This works fine 'till you get some hierarchy of unpredictable depth in your models.

Consider an example:
```python
    class Category(MPTTModel):  # MPTTModel is a class from `django-mptt`, it allows to create tree structures with Categories as nodes
        parent = TreeForeignKey('self')  # foreign key to parent Category
        slug = ...
        ...

    class Photo(models.Model):
        category = models.ForeignKey('Category')
        slug = ...
        ...
```

Usually you create urlpattern like this:
```python
    r'^gallery/(?P<category_slug>[-\w]+)/(?P<photo_slug>[-\w]+)$'
```

Therefore you restrict all your URLs to be as:

    /gallery/mountains/mountain-photo/

It is quite human-readable (and fast!), but you lose all Category's hierarchy. You'd better have URLs like this:

    /gallery/nature/mountains/mountain-photo/
    /gallery/nature/animals/frogs/green-frogs/green-frog-in-water/
    /gallery/portraits/jina/

These URLs are ["clean" / "semantic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL), and django-clean-urls will help you to create them easily.

## Third-party app support
Django-clean-urls supports two main tree-structure apps for Django:

- django-mptt-urls
- django-treebeard

However, it's super easy to work with *any* hierarchy, no matter how you organize it.

## Requirements
- django (tested on but not restricted to v1.10)

## Example
TIP: All of the source code described below is available in *example* folder. It is a test project already set-up and ready-to-go, so you can `git clone https://github.com/c0ntribut0r/django-clean-urls` and play with it (administrator login/password: admin/rootroot).

Let's create a photos portfolio (gallery) app with super-complicated hierarchy where we'll cover all use-cases of django-clean-urls.

#### Depth 1: Photographer

First, lets create a Photographer model (pretty easy one).
```python
    # gallery/models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Photographer(models.Model):
        slug = models.SlugField()
        # ...
```

Now, lets create "clean url" pattern. Comments explain what's going on.
```python
    # gallery/urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import url

    from clean_urls.views import CleanURLHandler

    from .models import Photographer
    from .views import HomeView, PhotographerView


    app_name = 'gallery'
    urlpatterns = [
        url(
            r'^(?P<slug>([-\w]+/)+)$',  # very generic regex
            CleanURLHandler(  # this class will do all dirty work for us
                (Photographer.objects.all(), PhotographerView.as_view()),  # search through all photographers and call PhotographerView on success
            ),
            name='generic'  # needed for reverse url resolution; call it "generic" because this url can point to many different objects
        ),
    ]
```

We've successfully set up simple clean url - it will fire PhotographerView at these urls:

    /jane/
    /jill/

Once CleanURLHandler gets slug `jill`, it searches for an instance in `Photographer.objects.all()` with `slug` field containing 'jill', and passes it to PhotographerView as `instance` kwarg. Now let's create the PhotographerView:
```python
    # gallery/views.py
    from django.views.generic import DetailView

    class PhotographerView(DetailView):
        template_name = 'gallery/photographer.html'

        def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):  # already resolved instance here!
            self.instance = kwargs.pop('instance')  # save instance
            return super().dispatch(*args, **kwargs)

        def get_object(self, queryset=None):
            return self.instance  # use saved instance
```

One more thing to do still remains - reverse url resolution (again, see comments):
```python
    # gallery/models.py
    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
    ...

    class Photographer(models.Model):
        # ...
        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('gallery:generic', kwargs={'slug': self.get_slug()})  # CleanURLHandler automatically created 'get_slug' method; for this simple model it will just return self.slug
```

That's it - now calling `Photographer.objects.get(slug='jill').get_absolute_url()` will return `/jill/`.

Now we need to go deeper Â©

#### Depth 2: Categories
Now let's make our app more complex. Let's allow each photographer to have his own categories and photos inside them.
```python
    # gallery/models.py
    from mptt.models import MPTTModel, TreeForeignKey

    class Category(MPTTModel):
        photographer = models.ForeignKey('Photographer')
        parent = TreeForeignKey('self', blank=True, null=True)
        slug = models.CharField('slug', max_length=32)

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('gallery:generic', kwargs={'slug': self.get_slug()})
```

Have a look at new `urls.py`:
```python
    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        url(
            r'^(?P<slug>([-\w]+/)+)$',
            CleanURLHandler(
                (Photographer.objects.all(), PhotographerView.as_view()),
                (Category.objects.all(), CategoryView.as_view()),  # here we state that Photographer may contain a Category within
            ),
            name='generic'
        ),
    ]
```
